# Enhancing Real Estate Valuation Models for Zingat

This repository contains a study on enhancing real estate valuation models for Zingat, an online marketplace for real estate transactions in Turkey.

## Problem

Real estate valuation is challenging due to the complexity and localization of the market. Zingat seeks to improve its valuation models to better serve its users.

## Methodology

The study follows a data-driven approach consisting of:
- **Data Preparation:** Handling missing values, outliers, and exploring relevant variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new variables and transforming existing ones to enhance predictive power.
- **Model Building:** Developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a linear regression model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the performance of both models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An ANN was developed to capture complex relationships in the data. It was trained and evaluated to assess its performance in predicting real estate values.

## Linear Regression

A traditional linear regression model was also built as a baseline for comparison. Its performance was evaluated alongside the ANN.

## Results

The ANN achieved a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to the linear regression model, indicating superior performance in predicting real estate values.
